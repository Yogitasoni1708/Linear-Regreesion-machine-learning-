#Linear regression in machine learning
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict outcomes based on continuous variables. The model was trained and tested on the Boston Housing dataset to estimate house prices.

🔍 Overview
Built a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between features and housing prices.
Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and ensure data quality.
Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on both training and testing datasets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

📈 Results
RMSE (Train): ~4.66
RMSE (Test): ~4.99
The model shows good generalization on unseen data.

Note
The load_boston() dataset used is deprecated due to ethical concerns. Use California or Ames Housing datasets for future implementations.
